# JobApplicationDjangoApp
A Python / Django-based web application that takes a user's first name, last name, email address, date, and occupation status and stores them in a SQLite3 database. 
The app also has an about page which describes the app in more detail, a page with the contact information of the programmer who made the app, and an admin mode which allows a superuser to access and modify data in the database.
